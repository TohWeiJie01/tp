### Glossary
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

| Term | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Command Line Interface (CLI)** | A **CLI** is a user interface that accepts text input to execute system functions.<br><br>RecruitIn uses a **CLI** interface to operate most of its features. |
| **Command** | **Commands** are user text inputs that executes certain features of RecruitIn. |
| **Prefix** | A **Prefix** is a fixed text input that indicates an applicant's detail.<br><br>For instance, `n/` is a Prefix that indicates an applicant's name.<br><br>It is used in commands to differentiate user inputs for different applicant details. |
| **Parameter** | A **Parameter** is a user text input that usually follows after a **Prefix**.<br><br>For instance, in `n/John`, `John` is a **Parameter** of **Prefix** `n/`.<br><br>In some cases, it does not have to follow a **Prefix**.<br><br>For instance, in `delete 1`, `1` is a **Parameter** of the `delete` command. |

### Basic Command Format
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Before moving on with this user guide, listed below are some **important** text formatting that you should take
note of so that you may better understand our feature descriptions.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you, the user.<br>
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.
* Words that are ***bold & italicized*** refers to a stored applicant detail for a certain prefix.<br>
  e.g. ***Name*** could refer to the value `John` stored as a name in the application.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` `[t/TAG]` can be used as n/John Doe t/friend or as n/John Doe.
* Items with `...` after them can be repeated multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `delete INDEX...` can be used as `delete 1` (i.e. `INDEX` repeated 0 times), `delete 1 2`, `delete 2 4 3` etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. If not, you can install it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
Download the correct version based on your operating system (e.g. Linux, macOS, Windows) and follow the Java installation instructions.

![Java 11 Download](./images/JavaDownload.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Visit the link and scroll down to find Java SE Development Kit 11 as shown above.**

</div>

2. Download the latest `recruitIn.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4).
Scroll down to the bottom and click on `recruitIn.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should be similar to the below image. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/ug-features/description.png)
   
   Applicant data are displayed as a list in the **Applicant Panel**.
   ![Applicant Diagram](images/ApplicantDiagram.png)

5. Now that your app is set up and running, lets run through a quick sample workflow on managing an applicant:<br><br>

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Type in your commands into the Command Box and press Enter to execute it.**<br>
    * e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br><br>
    </div>

   1. Use **`clear`** command to clear the existing sample data.<br><br>
   2. Suppose you have an applicant named `John Doe` and you want to add him to
      your list of applicants. `John Doe` has kindly provided you his phone number, `98765432` and email `JohnDoe@gmail.com`. He is applying for the role of a `Teacher` and plans to work `Full time` with an expected salary of `3000`. His highest level of
      education is `Bachelors` and has `4` years of experience as a teacher. <br><br>
      Type in **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/JohnDoe@gmail.com r/Teacher et/Full time s/3000 l/Bachelors y/4` to add `John Doe` to your
      list of applicants.<br><br>
   3. Let's also add in another applicant named `Mary Sue`. Her phone number is `91131513` and her email is `MarySue@gmail.com`. She is applying
      for the role of a `Software Engineer` and is looking for an `Internship` with an expected salary of `3000`. Her highest level of education is `High School`
      and has `0` years of experience as a `Software Engineer`. <br><br>
      Type in **`add`**`n/Mary Sue p/91131513 e/MarySue@gmail.com r/Software Engineer et/Internship s/3000 l/High School y/0`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Adding](images/ug-features/SampleWorkflow1.png)<br><br>
   4. As an experienced recruiter, you notice that `Mary Sue` may not have the qualifications for the job as a `Software Engineer` and want to add
      a note to remind yourself.<br><br>
      Type in **`edit`**`2 nt/She might not have the qualifications for the job` to add the note to `Mary Sue`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Note](images/ug-features/SampleWorkflow2.png)<br><br>
   5. Your company then informs you that they would like to interview `John Doe` on December 11th 2021 at 10 am `2021-12-11, 10:00` and you want to remind
      yourself that an interview has been arranged for `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Type in **`edit`**`1 i/2021-12-11, 10:00` to add this interview slot to `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Interview](images/ug-features/SampleWorkflow3.png)<br><br>
   6. Fast forward the time. Your company informs you that `John Doe` has
      passed his interview and is hired.<br><br>
      Type in **`find`**`n/John Doe p/98765432` to find `John Doe`.<br>
      Type in **`mark`**`1` to mark `John Doe` as Done.<br><br>
      ![After mark](images/ug-features/SampleWorkflow4.png)<br><br>
   7. Type in **`list`** to go back to your list of applicants.<br><br>
      Type in **`delete_marked`** to remove all applicants marked as Done, such as `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Now `John Doe` is removed from your list of applicants.<br><br>

6. Aside from the commands shown in the sample workflow above, you may also find these useful:

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
    The commands given below are not related to the sample workflow given above and are given strictly as example usages.
    </div>

### Listing all applicants : `list`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `list` command shows a list of all applicants in RecruitIn.

Format: `list`


### Deleting an applicant : `delete`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `delete` command deletes applicants by their index from the applicants list in RecruitIn.

Format: `delete INDEX...`

***Note:*** *As mentioned in [Basic Command Format](#basic-command-format), you can delete multiple applicants by including one or more indexes here.*

* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed applicants list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** such as 1, 2, 3, …​
* `INDEX` in RecruitIn **starts from one**.
*  You should type at least one `INDEX`. (i.e. `delete ` is not a valid command)
*  You should not type duplicate `INDEX`s. (i.e. `delete 2 2` is not a valid command)
* You should not type`INDEX` which exceeds the total number of applicants in the displayed applicants list.

Examples:

* After you execute the command `find n/John`, `delete 1` deletes the 1st applicant in the results of the `find` command.
* After you execute the command `list`, `delete 1 2` deletes the 1st and 2nd applicants listed in RecruitIn.

Before: ![DeleteBefore](images/ug-features/DeleteBefore.png)
After: ![DeleteAfter](images/ug-features/DeleteAfter.png)


### Finding an applicant : `find`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `find` command finds applicants by specific prefixes.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [r/ROLE] [et/EMPLOYMENT_TYPE] [s/EXPECTED_SALARY] [l/LEVEL_OF_EDUCATION] [y/YEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE]  [t/TAG]  [i/INTERVIEW] [nt/NOTES] [d/DONE]`

***Note:*** *As mentioned in [Basic Command Format](#basic-command-format), you can include one or more of the search terms.*

* You can key in parameters in either UPPER CASE or small case. 
* If you key in multiple of the same prefix (e.g. `find n/alex n/bernice`) , the program will only find you applicants based on **the last** prefix (i.e. `n/bernice`).
* You can key in each prefix with **multiple keywords** separated by whitespace, e.g. `n/John Mary`, `t/friend colleague`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

* You can search for tags using multiple keywords by providing your parameters separated by whitespace in a `t/` prefix. (i.e. `find t/smart kind`)
    * This is different from `add` and `edit` commands which require tag parameters to be provided separately. (i.e. `edit 1 t/smart t/kind`)

</div>

* You should not find applicants by a prefix with empty parameters. (i.e. `find d/` will show you all applicants **unfiltered** by their ***done*** status)

Examples:
* `find n/alex n/bernice` finds you all applicants with only `bernice` as values for name prefix.
  
Before: ![FindBefore](images/ug-features/FindBefore.png)
After: ![FindAfter](images/ug-features/FindAfter.png)


* `find n/John Mary` finds you all applicants with either `John` or `Mary` as values for name prefix.
* `find t/friend colleague` finds you all applicants with `friend` or `colleague` as values for tag prefix.
* `find n/John Mary t/friend colleague`
* `find n/Bob p/87654321 e/bob@gmail.com r/Software Engineering et/Full time s/4000 l/High School y/2 nt/has the credentials d/Not Done`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:information_source: Prefix parameters for `find` command must follow the following parameter specifications:**<br>

* You may
    * refer to [**Find Parameter Specifications**](#find-parameters) for detailed parameter specifications, or
    * refer to find parameter specifications for a specific prefix by clicking on the relevant link in the table below.

| Parameter | Prefix | Specifications |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| NAME | `n/` | [**name**](#name-n-1) |
| PHONE_NUMBER | `p/` | [**phone_number**](#phonenumber-p-1) |
| EMAIL_ADDRESS | `e/` | [**email_address**](#emailaddress-e-1) |
| ROLE | `r/` | [**role**](#role-r-1) |

| INTERVIEW | `i/` | [**interview**](#interview-i-1) |
| NOTES | `nt/` | [**notes**](#notes-nt-1) |
| DONE | `d/` | [**done**](#done-d) |

</div>
        
### Filtering interviews : `filter_interview`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `filter_interview` command filters applicants by interview dates based on whether they are upcoming or have past current date and time.
Differs from ```find i/``` as it is not returning you all applicants with a specific interview date but 
rather all applicants with interviews that fall into the same group (`past` or `future`).

Format: `filter_interview past` or `filter_interview future`

* `filter_interview past` shows you applicants with interviews that were in the past (compared to the current date and time).
* `filter_interview future` shows you applicants with interviews that are coming up in the future (compared to the current date and time).

Before: ![FilterInterviewBefore](images/ug-features/FilterInterviewBefore.png)
After: ![FilterInterviewAfter](images/ug-features/FilterInterviewAfter.png)

* You should give either `past` or `future` as a parameter after `filter_interview`, but not both.
* You can type in either UPPER CASE or small case for `past` and `future`.
  

Examples:
* Let's assume that the current time is [29th October 2021, 1600].
* If you type`filter_interview past` or 
 `filter_interview pAsT` in the command box, you are able to see applicants with interviews that were before and including
  [29th October 2021, 1600].
* If you type `filter_interview future` or 
 `filter_interview fUTURE` in the command box, you are able to see applicants with interviews that are after [29th October 2021, 1600].
  

### Showing search terms : `show`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `show` command shows you unique search terms which you can use for a specific prefix.

Format: `show [n/] [p/] [e/] [r/] [et/] [s/] [l/] [y/] [t/] [i/]`

***Note:*** *As mentioned in [Basic Command Format](#basic-command-format), you can include any one of the prefixes in square brackets  here.*

* You should type **only 1** prefix that you want the program to show.
    * If you type multiple prefixes after `show`, the program will only show you the unique search terms found for the **first** prefix parameter.

Examples:
* `show i/` will display a list consisting of all interview timings.
* `show n/ i/` will display a list consisting of all names.
    
Before: ![ShowBefore](images/ug-features/ShowBefore.png)
After: ![ShowAfter](images/ug-features/ShowAfter.png)



### Marking an applicant : `mark`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Every applicant in RecruitIn will have a status of either `Done` or `Not Done`.
A `Done` status means that you are done handling the applicant and no longer need to keep their details.
The `mark` command marks the specified applicant(s) in RecruitIn by changing their status to `Done`.

Format: `mark INDEX…​`

* RecruitIn marks the applicant at the specified `INDEX`es as `Done`.
* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in RecruitIn's displayed applicants list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive whole number**, i.e. 1, 2, 3, …​
* `INDEX` should not exceed the total number of applicants in RecruitIn's displayed applicants list.
* `INDEX` in RecruitIn **starts from one**.
* You must give at least one `INDEX`. (i.e. `mark ` is not a valid command)
* You cannot give duplicate `INDEX`es. (i.e. `mark 2 2` is not a valid command)
* You cannot mark an applicant that has status `Done`.

Examples:
* After using the command `list`, `mark 1` marks the 1st applicant listed in RecruitIn as `Done`.

* After using the command `list`, `mark 2 4 6` marks the 2nd, 4th and 6th applicant listed in RecruitIn as `Done`.
* After using the command `find n/John`, `mark 1` marks the 1st applicant listed in RecruitIn's results of the `find` command as `Done`.


### Unmarking an applicant : `unmark`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Every applicant in RecruitIn will have a status of either `Done` or `Not Done`.
A `Not Done` status means that you are still handling the applicant and still need to keep their details.
The `unmark` command unmarks the specified applicant(s) in RecruitIn by changing their status to `Not Done`.

Format: `unmark INDEX…​`

* RecruitIn unmarks the applicant at the specified `INDEX`es to `Not Done`.
* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in RecruitIn's displayed applicants list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive whole number**, i.e. 1, 2, 3, …​
* `INDEX` should not exceed the total number of applicants in RecruitIn's displayed applicants list.
* `INDEX` in RecruitIn **starts from one**.
* You must give at least one `INDEX`. (i.e. `unmark ` is not a valid command)
* You cannot give duplicate `INDEX`es. (i.e. `delete 2 2` is not a valid command)
* You cannot unmark an applicant that has status `Not Done`.

Examples:
* After using the command `list`, `ummark 1` unmarks the 1st applicant listed in RecruitIn to `Not Done`.

* After using the command `find n/John`, `unmark 1` unmarks the 1st applicant listed in RecruitIn's results of the `find` command to `Not Done`.


### Deleting marked applicants : `delete_marked`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `delete_marked` command deletes all applicants that are currently marked as `Done`.
This provides an easy way for you to delete the data of all applicants you no longer need.

Format: `delete_marked`

Example:

Before: ![images](images/ug-features/DeleteMarkedBefore.png)

After: ![images](images/ug-features/DeleteMarkedAfter.png)


### Clearing all data : `clear`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `clear` command deletes all applicants in RecruitIn.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

The `exit` command causes RecruitIn to close and exit.

Format: `exit`

You can also exit RecruitIn by clicking on the 'X' button found on the top right side of the app.
Alternatively, you can also click on the 'File' button on the upper left of the app, before clicking the pop-up 'Exit' button. 


### Saving the data
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

Whenever you use any command which edits, updates or adds data, RecruitIn automatically saves the data.
You do not need to manually save data with any command. The saved data also automatically loads when the application starts.

### Editing the data file
[Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

RecruitIn saves the applicant data as a String in `/data/applicants.json`.
If you are advanced enough, you are welcome to update data directly by editing this data file.

Example of the format of how data is saved for an applicant:

```JSON
{
  "persons": [
    {
      "name" : "Alice Yeoh",
      "phone" : "87438807",
      "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
      "role" : "Software Engineering",
      "employmentType" : "Full time",
      "expectedSalary" : "3600",
      "levelOfEducation" : "High School",
      "experience" : "2",
      "tagged" : [],
      "interview" : "-",
      "notes" : "This applicant is a suitable candidate for the job!",
      "done": "Not Done"
    }
  ]
}
```
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes the data format invalid, RecruitIn will remove all saved data and start with an empty data file the next time you open the app.
It is advised that you be careful when handling the data file directly!
