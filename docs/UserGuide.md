## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Words that are ***bold & Italicised*** refers to a stored prefix value. 
  e.g. ***Name*** could refer to the value `John` stored as a name in the application.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be repeated multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `delete INDEX...` can be used as `delete 1` (i.e. `INDEX` repeated 0 times), `delete 1 2`, `delete 2 4 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Sections with headings appended with ***{Advanced}*** are intended for the advanced user.

* Duplicate applicants are not allowed. For two applicants to be duplicate, 
they must have the same ***Contact Number*** and ***Email***. An error message will show if you attempt to
`add` or `edit` applicants in a manner that will lead to duplicate stored applicants.

### Saving the data

RecruitIn data is saved to the hard disk whenever there is a command that edits, updates or adds data.
There is no need to save data manually with a command. Data also automatically loads when the application runs.

### Editing the data file

RecruitIn data is saved as a String in `/data/applicants.json` for applicant data.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

Example of format of data for one applicant in applicants:

```JSON
{
  "persons": [
    {
      "name" : "Alice Yeoh",
      "phone" : "87438807",
      "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
      "role" : "Software Engineering",
      "employmentType" : "Full time",
      "expectedSalary" : "3600",
      "levelOfEducation" : "High School",
      "experience" : "2",
      "tagged" : [],
      "interview" : "-",
      "notes" : "This applicant is a suitable candidate for the job!",
      "done": "Not Done"
    }
  ]
}
```
